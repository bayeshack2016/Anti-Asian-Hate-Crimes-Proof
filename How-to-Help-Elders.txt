# Where to donate/help the elders during this pandemic?
Activism
## I want to do something to help at least order food/groceries to the Asian elders in the area close to me that are afraid to go out due to this crisis. I don't want to see any of them get hurt or deal with racism right now amidst all this. Is there any organizations out there already doing this?

> Just look for the asian community outreach programs through the department of health and human services. https://www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org/ there are also free asian community newspapers at the asian grocery stores you can find info from them.



> If your area has a “Chinatown” - you can try googling that with the name, and the city you live in Or maybe u can leave some flyers with contact info at their doorstep?! Good for u for wanting to help :)


> Check the social media of Asian churches as they may already be preparing for elder care and sustainance in their area. Also, check the storefronts of older restaurants because they will often have community resources posted there.
